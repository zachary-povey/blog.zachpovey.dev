Hello, and welcome to my blog!

I'm a platform and data engineer that likes to write stuff down. I figured some of my writings may be of use to other people so I decided to make them public.

Please feel free to get in touch to discuss or counter anything I describe, declare or promote. I like having robust and productive debates about things, but anyone with a toxic attitude will be told to do one.

I've learnt the hard way that I am often wrong about things so readers take my advice at their own risk. When I am right about something, I'm probably not the first person to say that thing, however sometimes hearing the same thing a different way can still be useful.
