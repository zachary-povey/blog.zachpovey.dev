# Zach's Blog

Hello, and welcome to my blog!

I'm a developer who likes to write stuff down. I figured some of my writings may be useful to other people, so I decided to make them public.

Feel free to get in touch to discuss, challenge, or debate anything I share here. I enjoy robust, productive conversations, but anyone with a toxic attitude will be told to do one.

I’ve learned the hard way that I’m often wrong, so take my advice at your own risk. When I do get something right, I’m probably not the first person to say that thing, but sometimes hearing the same idea in a different way can be valuable.
